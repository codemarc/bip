It has been a few weeks since I was last on the links. Gary and I got paired up with Kevin and Navid. These guys are have a much lower handicap than us, so I amy need to step up my game. Kevin is a 9 and Navid is a 10 where Gary is a 17 and I am a 23

Distance tips of the day:
1. Open your stance.
2. Open your right heel to about 10 degrees.
3. Tee the ball higher
4. Swing up at the ball.
5. Rotate in balance.

Apre Golf: 
So it didnt go so well. I shot 102 (50 on the front and 52 on the back). I huess I need to spend more time on the range. I need to remember to [post my score](https://www.ghin.com/login).

Later in the day I went to visit my parents. It was a typical day for mom and an a tough day for dad. We went through a stipulation agreement from the lawyer on my sisters issues and it turns our that she needs to pay that lawer with a bank or certified check by Tues Oct 15th. Monday is a bank holiday so the windows is very small and the clock is ticking.
