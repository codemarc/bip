Gary and I got paired up with Kevin and Navid. These guys are have a much lower handicap than us, so I amy need to step up my game. Kevin is a 9 and Navid is a 10 where Gary is a 17 and I am a 23

Distance tips of the day:
1. Open your stance.
2. Open your right heel to about 10 degrees.
3. Tee the ball higher
4. Swing up at the ball.
5. Rotate in balance.
