#### Mon Oct 14, 2024 at 06:19 - Columbus Day

Columbus Day commemorates Christopher Columbus's landing in the Americas on October 12, 1492. It is celebrated on the second Monday of October each year. Columbus Day was established to honor Columbus's expedition, which is traditionally viewed as a pivotal moment in the history of European exploration of the Americas. It was seen as a way to celebrate Italian-American heritage, as Columbus was Italian. Italian-American communities, in particular, have long held Columbus in high regard and use the day for parades and festivities celebrating their culture.

In recent years, Columbus Day has become controversial. Critics argue that Columbus's arrival marked the beginning of centuries of colonization, enslavement, and genocide for Native American populations. As a result, many people oppose celebrating Columbus as a hero. 

In response to these criticisms, many states, cities, and organizations now recognize **Indigenous Peoples' Day** instead of or alongside Columbus Day. This holiday honors the culture, history, and contributions of Native American peoples and highlights the suffering they endured as a result of European colonization.

Columbus Day is still a federal holiday, meaning government offices and many businesses close for the day. However, many states, including Alaska, Hawaii, and South Dakota, do not celebrate it. In some places, Indigenous Peoples' Day has been adopted as an official replacement for Columbus Day.
