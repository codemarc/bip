#### Blogs in Progress - source repo for my writings

As once explained by the architect in the [matrix reloaded][redux] this is not the first version of my attempts to learn in public. I have a private project that I have been working on and off for some time now: [ntmfs - notes to my future self][ntmfs].
It was supposed to be a public project, but over time secrets (that should not be shared) have seeped in. So that brings us to Blogs in Progress (bip).

The concept of "learning in public" is not attributed to one specific person, but it has become popular through various developers and creators in the tech community. The idea emphasizes sharing your learning process openly, such as blogging, tweeting, making videos, or contributing to open-source projects, and it has gained traction as part of the broader open-source and knowledge-sharing movements.

This time my target audience is more then myself and the material in this repository is used for research and reference  As I document my discoveries and share them in prose, I expect to create the [learning in public][swyx] environment that an instructor friend of mine, [Shawn Wang][swyx] once proposed. I am very exciting ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) to get started once again.
