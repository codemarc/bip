This year the fast begins at sundown on the 10th of October and ends at sundown on the 11th of October. We had a breakfast that included old friend and new. Jaimie and Jeff, Gary and Jill, Tracy, Joe and Joe's son, Irina and Marc, Julie and Jeff, Mal, Brooke, Jared, Ally and of course, the two of us. Add in puppy leo and its 18, the symbol of chai (meaning life). Let it be a good year and may we all be healthy and happy and inscribed in the book of life. Amen.
