##### Wed Oct 09, 2024 at 10:00am - Create timestamp snippet

Since I use a lot of snippets, I thought I would create a way to source them.
To install the snippets:  

1. Open the Command Palette by pressing Cmd+Shift+P.
2. Type "Preferences: Configure User Snippets" and select it.
3. Choose "markdown.json" to create or edit snippets for Markdown files.
4. paste the code from mysnippets/markdown.json into the editor.
5. Save the file. and reload VS Code.
